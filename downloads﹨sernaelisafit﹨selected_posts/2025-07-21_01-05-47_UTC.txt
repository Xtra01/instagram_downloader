here’s to being intentional with the movement of your body for many different reasons 🫶🏻

I spend about 20 minutes daily, trying to not only stretch but strengthen every bone and muscle in my being

the good part is it can be done at any time of the day, prior to your workout, first thing in the morning, in the end of the night, etc 🌱

here’s your reminder to nurture it and allow for its full potential, happy Sunday 🖤

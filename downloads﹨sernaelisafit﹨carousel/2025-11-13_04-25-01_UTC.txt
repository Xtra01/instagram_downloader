October 2025 I celebrated 4 years of personal training, friendships, growth and love ⭐️

Over the last four years I have had the privilege of working with beautiful, intelligent, funny, dedicated women who have helped me discover the passion inside me that comes with helping people transform their lives inside and outside of the gym. 
I have gotten to know their likes and dislikes, who they are at their true core and I have been more than blessed to be able to guide them through their journey

They have taught me more than they could understand and I have loved watching them grow physically and mentally. 
Personal training is more than just the hour sessions, the cardio, the check ins, the meal plans, it is an opportunity they have taken up for themselves to be challenged, pushed, encouraged and I am forever grateful that they trusted me with that part of their lives.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank each and every one of you for allowing me to be a part of your life, 
For anyone who has worked with me, I am beyond grateful to have gotten to know you, push you, educate you and most important of all, watch you become the best version of yourself 
Here’s to four amazing years of growth, laughs, cries, therapy sessions, bad and good workouts ❤️
